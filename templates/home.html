            <h4><b><u>OVERVIEW</u></b></h4>
            <p><h5>A* and IDA* search are a set of state space searching algorithms that find an optimal path from a beginning
            state to a known destination state. They can be used to solve a variety of problems from solving a puzzle
            with the least amount of steps to find the quickest path through a maze.</h5>
            <p><h5>Both these algorithms are similar in nature in that they try to intelligently select the order of the
            paths they explore. They both do this by using a heuristic function that scores how close (in terms of steps
            to reach the goal node) a node is to the goal node. The general idea is that we want to explore paths that lead
            to nodes that are more similar to the goal node and have a short path from and starting node. To achieve this both
            algorithms use a f value to score nodes and the f value is the sum of the nodes heuristic value and the length of
            the path to get this node. We explore nodes with a smaller f value before looking at ones with a larger f value.
            This pushes us to nodes that are getting more similar to the goal node while also having a shorter path.<br/><br/>
            An important characteristic of the heuristic function is that it must be admissible. A heuristic function is
            admissible if it underestimates or calculates the exact number of steps to reach the goal node. If the heuristic
            function is not admissible we cannot guarantee the optimal path will be found.<br/><br/>
            The main difference about these two algorithms is the process in which they explore the search space. In A* a
            priority queue is used to keep track of all possible children nodes queued to be explored. This means there can
            be a large number of nodes sitting in the queue which can waste a large amount of memory. IDA* on the other hand
            searches the graph in an iterative fashion exploring the search space at increasing depths per iteration. In each
            iteration it only stores the current path being explored. This leads to the memory usage being linear to the length
            of the path being explored. The downside to IDA* is that the same paths will be revisited on each iteration possibly
            resulting in a longer runtime.</h5>
