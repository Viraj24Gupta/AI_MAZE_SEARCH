<h1>Background</h1>
Our project consists of 2 parts- i) Backend which is coded in c++ and php . We have solved the maze path finding using the IDA* Algorithm and the A* Algorithm . We have then compared the  algorithms on 2 parameters- No of moves required to reach the  goal by the user and second the time taken by each algorithm to help reach the goal thus co paring the efficiency of the 2 algorithms.<p> </p>
Finally we have implemented the frontend using HTML, PHP <p> </p>
  <h1>How to go about the code</h1>
  Clone the repository to your IDE.<br/>
  The A* and IDA* codes are present in their respective cpp files.<br/>
  The Templates folder contains html,css,js and php files for a better and proper implementation of the maze problem.<br/>
  The inputgen.cpp file contains the code for taking the input matrix with 0's  as the feasable path and 1's being the obstacles<br/>
  You can run the whole project and test it from the website.
  First you have to run apache server for localhosting then add the files to the htdocs folder of the apache folder
  and finally run and test the whole project.
