This is the repositry for our project Tilted 'Implementation of IDA* Algorithm' done for the course CSE 2003 Data Structures and Algorithms submitted to 
the 'School of Computer Science and Technology' of Vellore Institute of Technology,Vellore,Tamil Nadu.
It was done under the guidance of Prof. Sanjiban Sekhar Roy
Our project consists of 2 parts- i) Backend which is coded in c++ . We have solved the maze path finding using the IDA* Algorithm and the A* Algorithm . We have then compared the  algorithms on 2 parameters- No of moves required to reach the  goal by the user and second the time taken by each algorithm to help reach the goal thus co paring the efficiency of the 2 algorithms.
Finally we have implemented the frontend using HTML, PHP
